(** QCheck-STM State Machine Test for Atomic Snapshot

    This test verifies the atomic snapshot against a sequential model using
    QCheck's State Machine Testing framework.

    == Your Task ==

    Complete the TODO sections below. The structure is provided, but you need
    to implement the key testing functions that define correctness.

    Study the examples from Lecture 3:
    - qcheck_stm_lockfree.ml

    == What is STM Testing? ==

    State Machine Testing compares your concurrent implementation against
    a simple sequential model:

    1. We define a model state (simple array representing registers)
    2. Each command (Update/Scan) has:
       - next_state: how it should update the model
       - run: how to execute it on the real implementation
       - postcond: verify real result matches model prediction
    3. QCheck generates random command sequences and checks if real
       execution matches model

(** Commands that can be performed on the snapshot *)

  | Update of int * int  (* Update(idx, value) *)

(* ============================================================================
   TODO: Implement next_state

   Update the model state according to the command.
   This defines the "correct" sequential behavior.

   Hints:
   - For Update(idx, value): update the model array at index idx
   - For Scan: the model state doesn't change (Scan is read-only)
   ============================================================================ *)

(** Precondition - all commands are always valid for snapshot *)
let precond _cmd _state = true

(** Run command on the real implementation *)
let run cmd snapshot =
  match cmd with
  | Update (idx, value) ->
      Snapshot.update snapshot idx value;
      Res (unit, ())
  | Scan ->
      let arr = Snapshot.scan snapshot in
      Res (array int, arr)

(* ============================================================================
   TODO: Implement postcond

   Check if the real result matches what the model predicts.

   Hints:
   - For Update: returns unit, should always succeed (return true)
   - For Scan: returns array, should match the model state
     BUT: due to concurrency, it might match an *earlier* state!

   For this assignment, we'll accept any valid state (this is a simplified
   postcondition - a full STM test for snapshots is complex due to the
   lock-free nature).

   Return true if result is acceptable, false otherwise.
